<hr><br>
<p><em>
    Tales of battle and victory,<br>
    Passed down through ages,<br>
    In the land of the free,<br>
    The victors wrote their pages.<br>
    <br>
    Tales of valor and camaraderie,<br>
    Colored by tainted pigments,<br>
    Of people who wrote history,<br>
    With idiosyncratic figments.<br>
    <br>
    Tales of oppression and greed,<br>
    Evil they bravely fought,<br>
    Of slaves that they freed,<br>
    And harmony that they brought.<br>
    <br>
    Tales twisted dire,<br>
    With strains of hyperbole,<br>
    By men of infinite desire,<br>
    With minds of infinitesimal control.<br>
</em></p>

<p><em>
    A child,<br>
    Child in love.<br>
    Painted the hills, kicked the ball,<br>
    Crest and trough, he loved it all.<br>
    <br>
    A man,<br>
    Product of environment.<br>
    Sought the fleeting, consumed the material,<br>
    Took more than gave, happiness never real.<br>
    <br>
    A child,<br>
    Creator reborn.<br>
    Ran the mile, sang the song,<br>
    Science and art, he practiced day long.<br>
    <br>
    A man,<br>
    Consumer reborn.<br>
    Sold his science, bartered his art,<br>
    For glory, product far from his heart.<br>
